The hardware description of a elevator board. A Verilog project for the Digital Systems Design course, Spring 2024.


## Tools
- Verilog
- ModelSim
## Implementation Details

You can find a detailed explanation of how I implemented this project in the Documents directory.
## How to Run
## Results

After a successful simulation, ModelSim should display the following:

I have explained this output in detail in a report that you can find under the Documents directory.

If you want to simulate the hardware description provided in this project yourself, you will need to install ModelSim.
